# Application Irritation

This is Application Irritation, an AI (geddit?) that helps you fill out online forms. Except, this AI does not follow the best design principles. It is a demonstration of what NOT to do while designing your AI-powered software. Your task is to sign up for a new account on our service against the wishes of AI!
